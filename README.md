# StudyAi

A smart study planner app I built to help manage my coursework. It uses a simple algorithm to prioritize tasks based on difficulty and deadlines.

## Tech Stack
- MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js (MERN)
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- `react-big-calendar` for the schedule view

## Features
- **Dashboard**: See all tasks and courses in one place.
- **AI Planner**: Auto-schedules study blocks for the week.
- **Analytics**: simple charts to track progress.
- **Guest Mode**: Try it out without singing up.

## Setup
1. Clone the repo.
2. Install dependencies: `cd client && npm install`, `cd server && npm install`.
3. Create a `.env` file in server with your Mongo URI.
4. Run `./start_app.sh` to start both servers.

## Future Plans
- Add drag and drop for the calendar.
- Improve the scheduling algorithm.
